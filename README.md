# Canon

A CLI utility for managing docker-based, canonical development environments. Just run `canon` and you'll be instantly dropped into a shell
in a clean development environent, with all your project/code available. Use it to run complex toolchains without installing locally, and
to avoid the dreaded "But it works on my machine!" when working with other developers.

## How it works

When run, canon creates a docker container using a project or user specified image (containing any/all needed development tools.)
It bind-mounts the project directory into the container at /host and maps an internal user to match the external user's UID and GID
(thus avoiding file permissions issues.) Optionally, it will also forward through an SSH agent and config, as well as .netrc files, so
that priviate git repositories can still be accessed.

## Installation

### Docker Requirements

Make sure you have a recent version of Docker installed. If unsure, run `docker version` to verify your system is working.
For Docker install instructions, see https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

### Homebrew

`brew install viamrobotics/brews/canon`

### Direct Install

Requires Go 1.19 or newer to be installed.

`go install github.com/viamrobotics/canon@latest`

Make sure your GOBIN is in your PATH. If not, you can temporarily add it with something like:
`export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"`
Note: This path may vary. See https://go.dev/ref/mod#go-install for details.

## Usage

Simply run `canon` with no arguments to get a shell inside the default canon environment.

Alternately, you can directly specify a command to be run.
Ex: `canon make tests`

### Arguments

Run `canon -help` for a brief listing of arguments you can set via CLI.

## Configuration

### Example Files

Configuration file examples can be found in the configs directory.

### Configuration Layers

Canon configuration options are grouped into profiles, making it easier to set up custom configurations and switch between them. When run,
multiple layers of configuration are parsed and merged, allowing local/user overrides of repo and default settings. From that, one profile
(the "active profile" is selected, and that is then used to set up the container.

The steps in the configuration parsing are as follows

1. User defaults (if present) are loaded from the `defaults` section of the user config file, overriding built-in default values.
		* User config is at `~/.config/canon.yaml` by default, but can be changed with the `-config` option.
2. Starting from the current directory, the file tree is searched upward for a project level config file named exactly `.canon.yaml`
    * `.canon.yaml` is expected to be at the root/top of any specific project.
    * The `path` setting is set automatically at runtime for all profiles in this config, so that they're tied to the root of the project.
3. All profiles in the user config are then merged, thus allowing user overrides of any project specific settings on a per-profile basis.
4. If `-profile` is specified on the command line, the named profile is loaded. Otherwise, things continue.
5. All loaded profiles with a `path` setting are searched for one that contains the current working directory.
    * This allows profiles to be automatically selected based on the current project/directory.
6. If no matching profile is found, the one named in the `profile` field of the user's `defaults` section is used.
7. If no default is set, the default profile is used (built-in values optionally overridden by the `defaults` section.)

Run `canon config` to see exactly what would be used at any point (and copy it to a profile in your config to modify.) Note that this may
change based on the current project/directory, as well as with different arguments provided to the command.

### Configuration Fields

Profiles are defined with the following fields:

* `arch` The architecture (`amd64`, `arm64`, `386`, `arm`, or `arm/v6`) to run the image as.
	- Note the architecture does NOT have to match the host in most cases where emulation is set up. See [Emulation](#emulation) below
	- Defaults to the detected current architecture.
* `image` The docker image used by this profile. Can be overriden by `-image`
	- Note, this should NOT be defined if using the architecture-specific image options below. It will override them all.
* `image_amd64` The AMD64 (x86_64) specific image to use when that architecture is selected.
* `image_arm64` The ARM64 (aarch64) specific image to use when that architecture is selected.
* `image_386` The 386 (x86) specific image to use when that architecture is selected.
* `image_arm` The arm (armv7l/armhf) specific image to use when that architecture is selected.
* `image_arm_v6` The arm/v6 (armv6l) specific image to use when that architecture is selected.
* `minimum_date` If the created timestamp of the image is older then this, force an update of the image.
	- This allows project maintainers to automatically notified canon (and canon users) when an update is needed for a project.
	- Obtain with `docker inspect -f '{{ .Created }}' IMAGE_NAME`
* `persistent` A boolean that determines if a profile should be run in persistent mode. (See [Persistent Mode](#persistent-mode) below.)
	- Defaults to `false`
* `ssh` A boolean, determining if SSH helpers should be set up. (See SSH below.) Can be overridden with `-ssh`
	- Defaults to `true`
* `netrc` A boolean, determining if the user's .netrc file should be (read-only) mounted to the container. Can be overridden with `-netrc`
	- Defaults to `true`
* `user` The user account (within the image) to enter the container as. Can be overriden by `-user`
	- This user's UID will be changed to match the external user's UID, or created if it does not exist.
	- defaults to `canon`
* `group` The group account (within the image) to enter the container as. Can be overriden by `-group`
	- This group's GID will be changed to match the external user's GID, or created if it does not exist.
	- Defaults to `canon`
* `path` The path to the "root" (top level) folder, which will be mounted at `/host` within the container.
	- This also sets which profile should be auto-selected when running canon in/beneath that location on the host.
	- This should **never** be used within project configs, as the path will be set automatically at runtime for project-based profiles.
		+ See `default` below for when a project config contains multiple profiles.
* `update_interval` A duration (in Go format) that determines how often to check for updates to an image.
	- Defaults to `24h0m0s`
* `default` A boolean to indicate the prefered profile when multiple profiles share the same path, such as a project with multiple profiles.

## Persistent Mode

By default, canon will launch a new docker container, and start a shell inside it, then when the user exits the shell, the docker container
is removed, so the next startup will be another "clean room." This can have drawbacks though, as it prevents multiple shells from being
opened in the same environment, and can make build/download caching inside the container somewhat useless. As an alternate mode, a profile
can be set with the "persistent" value set to true. In this mode, any canon executions that use that profile will be run in the same
container. Exiting a shell (or a command ending) will not terminate the container either.

### Listing active containers

Run: `canon list` to list all currently running canon containers.

### Stopping persistent containers

Note: This usually isn't needed. Idle containers use only a small amount of resources, but if you want to reclaim some of it, you can stop them.
Run: `canon stop` to stop the container that would currently be used (what is shown from `canon config`.)
Optionally `-a` can be appended to stop ALL canon-managed containers (everything shown by `canon list` above.)
Persistent containers will be automatically restarted (with their contents intact) when needed again. Ephemeral (one-shot) containers will be automatically removed if stopped however, effectively the same as terminating them.

### Terminating containers

Run: `canon terminate` to terminate the container that would currently be used (what is shown from `canon config`.)
Optionally `-a` can be appended to terminate ALL canon-managed containers (everything shown by `canon list` above.)

## Emulation

Docker can be used cross-architecture, such as running arm64 images and toolchains on amd64, and vice versa. This is enabled by default
on the MacOS versions of docker.

On Debian and Ubuntu, you can follow [Debian's qemu instructions](https://wiki.debian.org/QemuUserEmulation) to set this up:

```sh
sudo apt install binfmt-support qemu-user-static
```

Most other Linux distributions should have a packaged version of [binfmt](https://github.com/tonistiigi/binfmt) and [qemu-user-static](https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static) that you can install to run containers on different architectures ([docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-platform/#qemu)).
Or you can run the following to try it out as a one-shot:

`docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static --reset -p yes`

Note: the one-shot approach will only last until the next reboot of the Linux system. See https://github.com/multiarch/qemu-user-static for more details.

## Updates

By default, canon will check for an updated image at startup once every update_interval. You can force an update with `canon update` or
you can update all images (that can be found from configs and your current working directory) with `canon update -a`.
If you have trouble, or want to reset the update times, remove the cache file(s) in `~/.cache/canon/`

Note that canon does *not* check for updates to itself, so you should occasionally reinstall to make sure you have the latest version.

## Creating Custom Docker Images

Nearly any linux image will work, provided it has a few basic utilities installed.
* bash
* passwd (passwd, useradd, usermod, groupadd, groupmod)
* libc-bin (getent)
* grep
* coreutils (cat, chown, cut)
* sudo (optional, user will be added to sudoers for password-less root)
* ssh (ssh, ssh-add) (optional, only needed when using ssh agent forwarding)

If custom toolchains/paths/configs, etc are needed, you should set up a normal user account in the docker configured as needed, then set
the user/group settings in the canon profile to point to it. Then whatever external account you call canon with will be mapped to that user
internally.

# Troubleshooting

Some basic steps to try when encountering various problems are below.

## Update canon

For almost any problem, it's always good to make sure you're running the latest version. There is no specific update procedure, just run
the install command again to get the latest version.

## Terminate persistent images

Stop (terminate) running persistent containers so they can be restarted. `canon terminate -a`

## Wipe the cache

If you have issues with updates, try clearing the update timestamp data. `rm -r ~/.cache/canon`

## Check Docker settings

If you're having trouble within Docker containers, and especially on MacOS, make sure you've allocated enough resources in the Docker
settings. Similarly, make sure Docker hasn't run out of disk space. Try running `system df` to see your Docker disk usage, and use
`docker system prune` to clean up, optionally with `-a` and/or `--volumes` depends on how much you want removed. Be careful, these commands
can and will remove non-canon related images, containers, and volumes as well.

## Hanging or slow setup of a new container

A common issue is that during initial startup, it may take several seconds to several minutes or more if the canon user (in the container)
owns a LOT of files. To avoid file permissions uses, the internal user's UID is modified, but this requires modifying the ownership of any
files that belong to that user. If you have an image that contains of lot of data in the user's home directory, this can take a while.

The workaround for this is to enable persistent profiles, so that only the first startup of a container has this delay. Subsequent calls
into the container will be nearly instant afterwards.

## Permission issues when extracting files/packages (MacOS only)

There's a bug in Docker for MacOS, and you need to change the settings to use "gRPC FUSE" for file sharing, instead of VirtioFS.
See https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/6614 for details.
